# Will the real Donald Trump please stand up?

Following the work done by [David Robinson] (http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) on Text analysis of Trump's tweets, I decided to give it a try as well using Python.

This work was really fun as data gives you new insights at each and every step. 

Work done:

Analysing tweets on the basis of:

1. Tweet timings- time when the tweet was tweeted.
2. Tweet content- whether manual retweet was done by copy-pasting and adding quotes
3. Tweet attachment- tweets with pictures and shared links
4. Tone analysis using IBM Tone analyser.

This work is in progess though as I am learning NLP so I would like to do Tweet content analysis in more detail.
